    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p> 
      Hello, I'm Elise Ballard. I'm a freelance event planner and artist from Arizona.
      Creating memorable experiences and environments is something I've been passionate about since I was very young. 
      I've studied as an artist with the goal to connect imagination to the paper, but as a planner it's my goal to connect the imagination with reality. 
      I will be receiving my Bachelor of Art in Spring 2022.
    </p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>
      The audience would be anyone who wants to hire someone who would design and coordinate themed events.
      Because of my niche, my audience would be people who would be particular about their event's themes.
      For example, a Great Gatsby-themed wedding or a fairy-themed child's birthday party would fall perfectly into my area of expertise.
      Anyone who strives to immerse their attendees in their event through their theme is the preferred audience that I'd like to collaborate with.

    <!-- ------------------------Steps 6-9------------------------------ -->

    <h3>Color Palette</h3>
    <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in Canvas then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

    <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below. Replace the href value that is there with yours. Make sure to paste it into both the href value and the content text of the <a> tag -->
    <p>Palette URL:</p>
    <a href="https://coolors.co/5b4b49-2c666e-e4dfda-d56f3e-84894a"
      target="_blank">https://coolors.co/396e94-e7c24f-a43312-381d2a-aabd8c</a>
